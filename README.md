Issue Description

X Education, an educational firm, specializes in offering online courses tailored for professionals in various industries. Daily, a substantial number of industry experts exploring course options visit the company's website. Following a form submission process on the site, individuals are categorized as leads. Subsequently, the sales team engages these leads through phone calls, emails, and other methods. While some leads undergo successful conversion, a significant portion does not. Typically, X Education attains a lead conversion rate of about 30%. To enhance efficiency, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, referred to as "Hot Leads." Identifying these leads is anticipated to augment the conversion rate, as the sales team can allocate more effort towards engaging potential leads, rather than indiscriminate outreach.

Business Aim

Lead X has tasked us with constructing a model that assigns a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each potential lead. This score will enable the identification of "Hot Leads," thereby bolstering the conversion rate. The CEO envisions achieving a lead conversion rate of 80%. The model should also accommodate future requirements, such as managing peak activity periods, optimizing manpower allocation, and determining post-target achievement strategies.
